Randomly or stratify select base count/daltons to stratify by bins
- use base counts

About 20 proteins selected in total proteins of af3 and md one

Md summary:
Just finds atom math and we give it specific atoms of proteins

.namd file is the main ones. Usually _eq to equilibrate then the run.namd
- pdb and pdf are structue 
-xsc is dimensions of the boundaries of the system



TODOs

1. Script to get PSF from PDB and XSC file (making XSC will be made from making PSF file)
2. Get a NAMD file and all to input

- PDB -> PSF + XSC
- NAMD file (run + eq)
- toppar




Main outputs:

.out or .log

Shows energy values every 1k time steps (picoseconds) (500k steps is about 1 ns)

.dcd files - binary files . Load into VMD , multiple frames of an MD each dcd is a frame, load with a psf.

Get structure from final dcd or final half of dcd . Analysis is tcl or PyVMD




Multiple stages:
Wanted to discover ab isoprene
Wanted to make a tool. 


- making timeline to compare accuracy of af2 to af3. How well does previous pipeline work to just docking with af3.
