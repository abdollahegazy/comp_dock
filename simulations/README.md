these simulations are to take 40 random complexes across the MD and AF3 derived complexes and compare them

1. figure out what 20 to sample (just a random sampling file) using `random_sampler.py`

- 1.1 icer is gonna need the data of all 40

- use pdb2cif `https://github.com/elija-feigl/pdb2cif` for allat (obabel was weird)

2. use `/sim_prep` to generate the XSC and PSF files from all the sampled options

3. do sims
