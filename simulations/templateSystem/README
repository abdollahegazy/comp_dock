this is a basic example of a molecular dynamics directory, with all the files
necessary to complete a basic simulation. The key files here are:

system.psf - structural file containing masses and other details
system.pdb - secondary structural file - doesn't contain all the data in the
psf but in many ways, quite similar.
system.xsc - describes the dimensions of the simulation's periodic boundary

toppar - a directory containing topology and parameter files describing the
shape, polarity, and structure of specific residues. These files will need to
be pointed to inside of the .namd scripts

system_eq.namd - a namd script responsible for an initial, equilibration run,
which attempts to quickly bring the system to a low energy state
system_run.namd - almost identical, a namd script responsible for longer
simulations of the system
