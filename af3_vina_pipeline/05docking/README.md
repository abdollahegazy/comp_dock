This structure has all things needed to run vina affinity scoring based on the equlibration (from NAMD) of the AF3
proteins. This is basically similar to what Duncan did with AF2 but with AF3 proteins. However,  it would require all the python scripts to be ran.
We did not finish/go through with this b/c decided it wasn't best interest. (we used af3 for docking straight away)
